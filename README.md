# inTune
inTune is a website for managing a record collection. You can add records, edit them or delete them.
The collection is searchable by artist, record name and year of release.

The site is built with C# and ASP.NET Core MVC. It was built with the purpose of learning more about Entity Framework Core and working with a database (Sqlite).

This was a part of an assignment in the course DT102G at Midsweden University.
